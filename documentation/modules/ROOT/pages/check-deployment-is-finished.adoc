= Check SNO Deployment is Finished
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:profile: 5g-ran-lab

In the previous section we have learned how to follow the cluster deployment process, but the cluster finished its deployment doesn't mean that the SNO deployment is complete.

We say that the SNO deployment finished when the SNO cluster has been deployed *and* day2 configurations have been applied. In this section we will learn how to verify that the configs have been applied and our sno2 is ready to run 5G RAN workloads.

[#check-sno-deployment-webui]
== Check SNO Deployment has Finished via the WebUI

1. Access the https://console-openshift-console.apps.hub.5g-deployment.lab/multicloud/home/welcome[RHACM WebUI] and login with the OpenShift credentials.
2. Once you're in, click on `Infrastructure` -> `Clusters`. You will see a screen like the one below, notice that there is a label saying `ztp-done` for the SNO2 cluster (that means ztp pipeline has finished):
+
image::acm-sno2-ztp-done.png[RHACM SNO2 ztp-done]
+
3. Additionally, we can verify that all policies are compliant for our `sno2` cluster and also the image-based installed `sno3`. On the RHACM WebUI go to `Governance` -> `Policies` and you will see the following screen where we can see all policies are green:
+
IMPORTANT: Applying policies on `sno2` can take up to 15 minutes after cluster has been fully deployed.
+
Notice that the sno3 node was already deployed and configured with the telco RAN DU profile previously in link:installing-imagebaseinstall-cluster.html[Deploying an Image Based Install Cluster]. So it is ready to run telco CNF applications as well.
+
image::acm-sno2-policies-done.png[RHACM SNO2 policies done]
+
IMPORTANT: See that the policies in the Governance section are also compliant for the `sno3` cluster even they were not applied via RHACM Policies. They were included in the seed image that was used to provision it and afterwards executed the reconfiguration process using the link:installing-imagebaseinstall-cluster.html#creating-the-configuration-iso[configuration ISO].
+
4. At this point the `sno2` is ready to run 5G RAN workloads *too*.


[#check-sno-deployment-cli]
== Check SNO Deployment has Finished via the CLI

IMPORTANT: Sometimes you may hit a https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-13286[bug] that will cause the policies to not be properly applied. Follow the instructions xref:troubleshooting-tips.adoc#olm-bug[here] if after 20 minutes policies are not ready.

IMPORTANT: Below commands must be executed from the workstation host if not specified otherwise.

1. Check the `ManagedCluster` for SNO2 cluster (including its labels). You should see the `ztp-done` label, just as we saw in the WebUI.

2. Check the policies are compliant for our SNO cluster.

oc --kubeconfig ~/hub-kubeconfig -n sno2 get policies

IMPORTANT: Applying policies on `sno2` can take up to 15 minutes after cluster has been fully deployed.

3. At this stage both `sno2` and `sno3` OpenShift Single-Node clusters are ready to run 5G RAN workloads.

//[#ensure-automation-ran-successfully]
//== Ensure AAP Automation Ran Successfully
//
//Now that SNO deployment is finished, automation should run as soon as the cluster is marked with the `ztp-done` label. We can easily check the labels on our `sno2` cluster via the OpenShift web console, under the `Infrastructure` > `Clusters` tab.
//
//There are a couple ways to ensure automation has run successfully.
//
//First, the Ansible job template used in this lab was configured to add an `aap-done` label to a cluster after it has run automation on it successfully, so notice that our `sno1` and `sno2` clusters now have the label `aap-done`.
//
//image::aap-done-label-sno1-sno2.png[SNO1/SNO2 AAP Done Label]
//
//Additionally, under the Applications tab on our OpenShift web console, if we search for `monitor-ztp-done`, we will see our automation Application. Let's take a look at this Application by clicking on its name. Notice the green check next to `Cluster resource status`, indicating automation has ran successfully. Now, navigating to the Topology tab we see a visual representation of the automation that has ran.
//
//image::aap-app.png[AAP Application]
//
//image::aap-app-topology.png[AAP Topology]
//
//Lastly, to view status and logs for the actual Ansible Controller job that ran, we can navigate to https://automation-aap.apps.hub.5g-deployment.lab, click on the "Jobs" tab, and view the latest job that ran.
//
//image::aap-jobs.png[AAP Jobs]
//
//image::aap-single-job.png[Single AAP Job]
//
//NOTE: As we can see the automation has run on every managed cluster with the label `ztp-done` and that is not the Hub cluster itself. This model of maintain one automation application for day 2 operations for N clusters makes utilizing ZTP and AAP automation together in a 5G RAN environment great at scale while also maintaining configuration control, as controlling which clusters run automation is as simple as adjusting the automation application's PlacementRule.
